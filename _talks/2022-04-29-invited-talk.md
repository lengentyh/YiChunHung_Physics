Abstract: Higher-order topological insulators are d-dimensional topological insulators with the absence of (d-1)-dimensional gapless states, of which the bulk-boundary correspondence is manifested as (d-2)-dimensional in-gap states instead. There are various mechanisms that generate such topological phases, still, a unified theory is lacking. A recent theory shows that the 0-dimensional in-gap states emerge at corners where two edges have phase difference between their mass of edge Dirac cones, which explains the origin of the in-gap states in higher-order topological insulators. Yet, the analyses retain in the pen-and-paper level or need the energy spectrum of a nano-disk/nano-ribbons with considerable size, which are both impractical to apply on real materials. I will briefly introduce the concept of mass-kink and demonstrate how to use it to predict the numbers and the distributions of the in-gap states. Then, I will present my recent works on using material specific tight-binding hamiltonians and real-space renormalization group through Greenâ€™s function to calculate the phases of mass for edge Dirac cones, which is not only computational cheap but also gives accurate values for fractional corner charges.
