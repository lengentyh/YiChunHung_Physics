Abstract:

Recent studies of topological phases characterized by a high-spin (or mirror) Chern number suggest the potential for realizing multiple helical edge states in low-dimensional quantum systems. In this connection, we demonstrate that electron interactions at the edges can drive correlated phases and that the system can be adiabatically connected to a time-reversal-symmetric topological superconductor, suggesting the emergence of Majorana Kramers pairs in the strongly interacting regime. We propose an experimental setup using cold atom systems, which could offer a new pathway for realizing fault-tolerant topological quantum computation.
