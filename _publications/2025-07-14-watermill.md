Moiré engineering offers new pathways for manipulating emergent states in twisted layered materials and lattice mismatched heterostructures. With the key role of the geometry of the underlying lattice in mind, here we introduce the watermill lattice, a two-dimensional structure with low-energy states characterized by massless pseudospin-3/2 fermions with high winding numbers. Its twisted bilayer is shown to exhibit magic angles, where four isolated flat bands emerge around the Fermi level, featuring elevated Wilson-loop windings and enhanced quantum geometric effects, such as an increase in the ratio of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature to the mean-field critical temperature under a weak Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing. We discuss how the watermill lattice could be realized in the MXene and group-IV materials. Our Letter highlights the potential of exploiting lattice geometry in moiré engineering to uncover novel quantum phenomena and tailor emergent electronic properties in materials.
