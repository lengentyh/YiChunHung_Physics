<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Pre-AI Technical Work (<span style="color: gray; font-size: 0.9em;">before 2022</span>)</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following works are adopted across both Dr. Hsin Lin and Prof. Tay-Rong Chang‚Äôs research groups.</p>
<ul>
  <li><p style="text-align: justify;">Led the consolidation of MATLAB codes on tight-binding models across projects into a unified framework to support consistent and maintainable development.</p></li>
  <li><p style="text-align: justify;">Established and managed the corresponding codebase through GitHub organization.</p></li>
  <li><p style="text-align: justify;">Designed and implemented a standardized variable and notation convention within the codebase to improve clarity, reusability, and collaboration.</p></li>
  <li><p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="/YiChunHung_Physics/matlab_codes">Deeveloped and Optimized MATLAB codes on tight-binding models.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>ü§ñ AI-Enhanced Research Practice (<span style="color: gray; font-size: 0.9em;">after 2022</span>)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><p style="text-align: justify;">Explored prompt engineering techniques for research writing using LLM.</p></li>
  <li><p style="text-align: justify;">Utilized AI-enhanced development environments (e.g., Cursor and Copilot) for research coding and side projects, including (but not limited to):</p></li>
    <ul>
      <li><p style="text-align: justify;">A Python script to automate sequential computation of SCF, relaxation, and BS in VASP.</p></li>
      <li><p style="text-align: justify;">A webpage tracking the manuscript status through interactive plots.</p></li>
      <li><p style="text-align: justify;">Some webpages in this web site.</p></li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>üìÑ Unpublished Research Works</h2>
<p style="color: gray; font-size: 0.9em;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">These projects were completed independently, of which I am the first author. Due to shifting research focus or publication priorities, they were not submitted for publication.</p>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Topic:</strong> Topological Two-Fold Fermions in Two- and Four-Dimensions<br>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 2023<br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Description:</strong> I discovered a four-dimensional lattice model with two-fold degenerated band touchings protected by non-trivial topology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Topic:</strong> Valley Topology<br>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 2023<br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Description:</strong> I analyzed a multilayer spin-valley locking system through projective spectrum. I discovered that the layer and the valley degrees of freedom are also locked in this system, and the topology carried by the valleys can thus be well-defined through projective spectrum.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Topic:</strong> Graph Theoretical Real-Space Renormalization Group For Tight-Binding Hamiltonian<br>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 2022<br>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Description:</strong> I used lattice graph description of tight-binding Hamiltonian to prove that it is impossible to use <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.31.5166">the renormalization method</a> to obtain the spectrum of localized states on higher-order boundaries (e.g., corners of a nanodisk or hinges of a cuboid etc.).</p>
