<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Helical edge states</strong> are 1D conducting channels where electron with different spin move in opposite directions. These states usually emerge at the edges of <strong>Quantum Spin Hall Insulators (QSHIs)</strong> (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.226801" target="_blank">Kane and Mele</a>). Their helical nature forbids elastic backscattering in the absence of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking, resulting in robust spin-polarized transport along the edge. However, in 1D systems, electron–electron interactions are inevitable and often play a crucial role in determining the low-energy physics (<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1MwTDAAAQBAJ" target="_blank">Giamarchi</a>). The helical nature prohibits backscattering but allows only forward scattering, making the system an ideal platform for realizing a <strong>helical Luttinger liquid (HLL)</strong> (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.96.106401" target="_blank">Wu et al.</a>). In this interacting regime, the edge states exhibit collective behavior and non-Fermi liquid characteristics, such as power-law scaling of correlation functions and interaction-dependent transport properties (<a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6641/ac2c27" target="_blank">Hsu et al.</a>). The helical Luttinger liquid thus provides a natural theoretical framework to capture the interplay between topology and strong correlations in one-dimensional edge systems.

<strong>Double Quantum Spin Hall Insulators (DQSHIs)</strong> extend the QSHI concept by supporting two independent helical edge channels, often arising from systems with high spin Chern or mirror Chern numbers <a href="#1">[1]</a><a href="#2">[2]</a>. Such a high spin (mirror) Chern number indicates that the edge Dirac cones are not protected by TRS and can be open due to spin-U(1) symmetry breaking perturbations. Also, the coexistence of multiple helical edge modes introduces the possibility of inter-channel forward scattering. This leads to a <i>higher-order topological insulator phase </i> <a href="#3">[3]</a><a href="#4">[4]</a>, as well as correlated phases supporting <i>Majorana Kramers pairs</i> <a href="#5">[5]</a> and <i>competing &pi;-superconductivity and &pi;-spin density wave</i> <a href="#6">[6]</a>.
