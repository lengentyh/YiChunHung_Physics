<h3>üõ†Ô∏è Pre-AI Technical Work (<span style="color: gray; font-size: 0.9em;">before 2022</span>)</h3>
<hr>
Adopted across both Dr. Hsin Lin and Prof. Tay-Rong Chang‚Äôs research groups.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Led the consolidation of MATLAB codes on tight-binding models across projects into a unified framework to support consistent and maintainable development.</li>
  <li>Established and managed the corresponding codebase through GitHub organization. </li>
  <li>Designed and implemented a standardized variable and notation convention within the codebase to improve clarity, reusability, and collaboration.</li>
  <li><a href="/YiChunHung_Physics/_pages/matlab_codes">Deeveloped and Optimized MATLAB codes on tight-binding models.</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>ü§ñ AI-Enhanced Research Practice (<span style="color: gray; font-size: 0.9em;">after 2022</span>)</h3>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li>Explored prompt engineering techniques for research writing using LLM.</li>
  <li>Utilized AI-enhanced development environments (e.g., Cursor and Copilot) for research coding and building webpages. Those who are not (and will not) presented in publications include:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Python script to automate SCF and BS calculations in order in VASP.</li>
      <li>A webpage tracking the manuscript status through interactive plots.</li>
      <li>Some webpages in this web site.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h3>üìÑ Unpublished Research Work</h3>
<hr>
<p style="color: gray; font-size: 0.9em;">
These projects were completed independently, of which I am the first author. Due to shifting research focus or publication priorities, they were not submitted for publication.

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Topic:</strong> Graph Theoretical Real-Space Renormalization Group For Tight-Binding Hamiltonian<br>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 2022
    <strong>Description:</strong> I used lattice graph description of tight-binding Hamiltonian to prove that it is impossible to use <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.31.5166">the renormalization method</a> to obtain localized states on higher-order boundary (e.g., corners of a nanodisk or hinges of a cuboid).
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Topic:</strong> Topological Two-Fold Fermions in Two- and Four-Dimensions<br>
    <strong>Time:</strong> 2023
    <strong>Description:</strong> I discovered a four-dimensional lattice model with two-fold degenerated band touchings protected by non-trivial topology.
