Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases establishes a robust framework to efficiently characterize ground state topology through internal (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.88.035005" target="_blank">Chiu et al., 2016</a>) or crystalline symmetries (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23268" target="_blank">Bradlyn et al., 2017</a>). However, the topological characterization in symmetry-breaking phases is comparatively less well-understood than that in SPT phases. Previous approach focusing on quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) without the spin-U(1) symmetry or time-reversal symmetry (TRS) utlizes <strong>the spectrum of the projected operator</strong>:
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
$$
\mathcal{P}_{\mathbf{\hat{S}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}}=P\mathbf{\hat{S}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}P,
$$
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
where \(P\) is the projection operator of the manifold of interest and \(\mathbf{\hat{S}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}\) is the spin operator (pointing to \(\mathbf{\hat{n}}\)-direction) of interest (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.80.125327" target="_blank">Prodan, 2009</a>), leading to the spin-resolved topology (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-44762-w" target="_blank">Lin et al., 2024</a>). In this framework, the ground state topology is characterized by the band topology of the spectrum of \(\mathcal{P}_{\mathbf{\hat{S}}\cdot\mathbf{\hat{n}}}\), which remains well-defined even when the spin-U(1) symmetry and TRS are broken. The corresponding bulk-boundary correspondence is also numerically demonstrated in previous work (<a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.196806" target="_blank">Li et al., 2012</a>). However, a rigorous proof and extensions to general cases beyond QSHIs remain to be elucidated.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
To address this long-standing issue, we generalize this scheme to consider <strong>a general translationally-invariant operator \(\hat{O}\)</strong> by following the idea proposed in <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.80.125327" target="_blank">Prodan, 2009</a>, focusing on the spectrum of:
</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">
$$
\mathcal{P}_{\hat{O}}=P\hat{O}P.
$$
</div>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Most importantly, <strong>we provide a rigorous mathematical proof of the corresponding bulk-boundary correspondence along with an experimental method to measure it</strong> <a href="#1">[1]</a>. This idea is then demonstrated in mirror Chern insulators without mirror symmetry and tailored lattice models <a href="#1">[1]</a>, as well as the topological orbital Hall effect in group IV materials <a href="#2">[2]</a>.
