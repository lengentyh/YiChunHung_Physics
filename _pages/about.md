Research Interests
=====

<hr>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am broadly interested in theoretical condensed matter physics and its applications to materials science. My current focus includes:
</p>

 - __Machine learning methods in material discovery__

 - __Moiré flat bands in twisted multilayers__, particularly:
  
    - __Band topology__, 
    
    - __Quantum geometry__, 
    
    - __Associated physical responses__.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
I also have experience in <strong>Luttinger liquid theory</strong> and <strong>band topology in the projected spectrum</strong>, and maintain an interest in <strong>non-equilibrium systems</strong>.
