Research Interests
=====

<hr>

I have a broad interest in theoretical condensed matter physics and its application to material science. I am now focusing on:

 - __Machine learning methods in material discovery__

 - __Moiré engineering in twisted multilayer systems__

 - __Band topology, quantum geometry, and their responses__

In addition, I have experience on studying __Luttinger liquid theory__ and am also interested in __non-equilibrium systems__.
