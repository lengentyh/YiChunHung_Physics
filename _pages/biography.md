Hi, I’m Yi-Chun Hung (洪逸群), a PhD student passionate about theoretical condensed matter physics.

I was born and raised in Hsinchu City, the heart of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. Surrounded by a community driven by science and engineering, I was inspired from an early age to develop a deep curiosity for the natural sciences.

My time in National Hsinchu Senior High School greatly shaped my character and values. We were encouraged to pursue academic freedom, engage in open discussions, and explore subjects based on our interests. That was when my interest in science deepened, from joining the school’s fossil excavation activities to using a second-hand microscope to study plants and small animals in my spare time, expanding on what I had learned from textbooks. Without choosing theoretical physics, I might have taken a different path as a biologist or biophysicist.

It is the one of the few high schools in the world to have a Nobel Prize medal, donated by Dr. Yuan-Tseh Lee, the 1986 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry. He believed high school was the turning point of his life, and I deeply resonate with that belief. Seeing the medal at the school entrance every day motivated me to strive for excellence in academics and scientific exploration. Alongside these experiences, our school motto, 「誠、惠、健、毅」, meaning “Integrity, Wisdom, Well-being, and Perseverance,” continues to guide my mindset and decisions. These principles remain central to my personal and professional growth.

Since then, I have pursued theoretical physics at National Taiwan University and the Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, two of the most respected academic institutions in Taiwan. I was later fortunate to pursue my Ph.D. studies in the US, which greatly broadened my research perspective and experience. Over the years, I have had the opportunity to work on cutting-edge topics, including quantum algorithms and the use of quantum computers through Qiskit on IBM’s platform, before moving on to topological materials and moiré physics. Building on this background, I always look forward to technological innovations. Therefore, in addition to applying machine learning in my current scientific projects, I am also developing my skills in using AI tools to continually enhance both my efficiency and the quality of my work.

Looking ahead, I aspire to broaden my horizons and apply my knowledge to drive scientific and technological progress, while staying true to the spirit of 「誠、惠、健、毅」.
