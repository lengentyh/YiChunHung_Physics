Hi, I’m Yi-Chun Hung (洪逸群), a PhD student passionate about theoretical condensed matter physics.

I was born and raised in Hsinchu City, the heart of Taiwan’s semiconductor industry. Growing up in a community shaped by science and engineering, I developed a deep curiosity for the natural sciences from an early age. My years at National Hsinchu Senior High School, which encouraged academic freedom and independent exploration, played a pivotal role in shaping my curiosity. I vividly remember joining fossil excavation activities and using a second-hand microscope to study plants and insects, sparking a broad interest in science that eventually led me to focus on theoretical physics.

One unique symbol of inspiration at my high school is a Nobel Prize medal donated by Dr. Yuan-Tseh Lee, the 1986 Nobel Laureate in Chemistry. Dr. Lee believed that high school is a turning point in life, and I deeply resonate with that belief. Passing by this medal every day reminded me of the value of perseverance and excellence in scientific exploration. Along with these experiences, the school motto, 「誠、惠、健、毅」 (Integrity, Wisdom, Well-being, and Perseverance), has shaped my personal and academic values, guiding me through every challenge.

I pursued theoretical physics at National Taiwan University (NTU) and the Institute of Physics, Academia Sinica, two of Taiwan’s leading academic institutions. My journey later took me to the United States for my Ph.D. studies at Northeastern University, which greatly broadened my research perspective and international collaborations. I deeply appreciate the open, collaborative, and highly interdisciplinary research environment in the U.S., which fosters creativity and accelerates scientific progress. Experiencing this culture has strengthened my determination to continue conducting research here, contributing to both fundamental science and technology.

During this period, I also explored quantum algorithms and quantum computing using IBM’s Qiskit platform at NTU, an experience that expanded my understanding of how fundamental physics can connect with emerging technologies. This exploration naturally led me to focus on condensed matter physics, where I now study moiré systems and topological phases of matter. More recently, I have been integrating machine learning and AI tools into my research, not only to accelerate scientific discovery but also to enhance efficiency and creativity.

Looking ahead, I aim to combine fundamental research with technological innovation, exploring new frontiers at the intersection of quantum physics, material science, and machine learning methods. I remain committed to the spirit embodied by 「誠、惠、健、毅」, which continue to guide both my scientific aspirations and my personal growth.
